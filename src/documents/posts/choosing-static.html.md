I've been building dynamic sites with PHP for a decade now. Big or small, I've been using some build of Drupal and Modules and piecing together content types, views and templates. The strength of the PHP community has meant I've rarely had to spend dev hours building something from scratch. PayPal, Instagram API or WYSIWIG, there's a module for it.

Recently, I've been diving into NodeJS and was amazed at the wealth of products built on it. While I appreciate GUIs, endlessly wrapped elements and obscure templating cues, I miss the immediacy of templating and desiging in code. Maybe it's the hipster minimalist in me but there's something really cool about rendering and serving static sites on a github pages.

There are a few JS based static site builders that I've come across, [Docpad](http://docpad.org/), [Hexo](http://zespia.tw/hexo/), [Assemble.io](http://assemble.io/), [Blacksmith](http://blacksmith.jit.su/) & [Wintersmith.io](http://wintersmith.io/). Most are inspired by their Ruby counterparts, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) & [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and function essentially the same, with EJS templating and MD source posts.

I decided to go with Docpad for my personal site for a few reasons, it was the quick to deploy, has great documentation and a strong community. I ported [Pure](http://purecss.io/) for the theme layer. More on Pure later.
